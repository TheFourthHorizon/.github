 - A beautifully crafted introduction to one of humanity’s oldest living wisdom traditions. This [episode](https://youtu.be/hlbP8LEIzII) brings Hinduism to life—not as a rigid “religion,” but as a profound, evolving philosophy rooted in unity, diversity, and spiritual freedom. Clear explanations of Atman and Brahman, dharma, karma, and moksha make complex ideas feel accessible and alive. The historical sweep—from the Indus Valley to modern practice—shows just how adaptable and expansive this tradition is. A compelling start to a series that promises real depth for anyone seeking to understand the foundations of global spirituality.
